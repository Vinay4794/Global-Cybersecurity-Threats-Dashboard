# Global-Cybersecurity-Threats-Dashboard
The Global Cyberthreat Dashboard provides insights into worldwide cybersecurity incidents by analyzing real-world data. It helps identify the most affected regions, types of attacks, and yearly threat patterns through powerful, interactive visualizations.
This project showcases how data analytics and visualization can turn complex datasets into actionable intelligence that supports better cybersecurity awareness and decision-making.

## 🧠Objectives

✅Analyze and visualize global cyber threat data.
✅Identify top targeted regions and countries.
✅Detect trends in attack frequency, severity, and type.
✅Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for dynamic insights.
✅Strengthen data storytelling and analytics skills.

## 🧩Key Features

✅ Data extraction and cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for identifying hidden patterns
✅ Integration of cleaned data into Power BI
✅ Interactive dashboards with filters and visuals for in-depth analysis
✅ Visualization of top attacks, affected regions, and evolving threat trends

## ⚙️Tech Stack
